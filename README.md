# CoffeeMachine
## Description
This is Jetbrains course: [hyperskill.org](https://hyperskill.org/projects/68?goal=391 "Coffe Machine project")
***

In this project, I make a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.


Also this machine can do multiple actions, one after another. The program should repeatedly ask what the user wants to do. If the user types "buy", "fill" or "take", then just do what the program did in the previous step. However, if the user wants to switch off the coffee machine, he should type "exit". Then the program should terminate. Also, when the user types "remaining", the program should output all the resources that the coffee machine has.


Also, it can be out of resources for making coffee. If the coffee machine doesn’t have enough resources to make coffee, the program should output a message that says it can't make a cup of coffee.


And the last improvement — if the user types "buy" to buy a cup of coffee and then changes his mind, he should be able to type "back" to return into the main cycle.
